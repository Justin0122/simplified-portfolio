I'm passionate about becoming a Full-Stack Laravel Developer. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my
skills in PHP, JavaScript, and C++, along with mastering Laravel, Livewire, and Tailwind CSS. I'm also
exploring microcontrollers as a side interest.

My goal is to build innovative web applications that provide seamless user experiences and solve
real-world problems.
